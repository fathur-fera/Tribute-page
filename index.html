            <p id="tribute-info">Peyton Williams Manning (born March 24, 1976) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons. 
                Considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, he spent 14 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and four seasons with the Denver Broncos. 
                Manning played college football for the University of Tennessee, leading the Tennessee Volunteers to the 1997 SEC Championship Game in his senior season.
                He is the second son of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and older brother of former NFL quarterback Eli Manning. Nicknamed "The Sheriff" due to his tendency to audible prior to the snap, Manning is one of the most recognizable and parodied players in the NFL.
                Teams led by Manning typically used the hurry-up offense in place of the standard huddle.</p>
