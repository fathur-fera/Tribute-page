        Peyton Williams Manning (born March 24, 1976) is a former American
        football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL)
        for 18 seasons. Considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all
        time, he spent 14 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and four seasons
        with the Denver Broncos. Manning played college football for the
        University of Tennessee, leading the Tennessee Volunteers to the 1997
        SEC Championship Game in his senior season. He is the second son of
        former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and older brother of former NFL
        quarterback Eli Manning. Nicknamed "The Sheriff" due to his tendency to
        audible prior to the snap, Manning is one of the most recognizable and
        parodied players in the NFL. Teams led by Manning typically used the
        hurry-up offense in place of the standard huddle.

        Manning was selected by the Colts as the first overall pick in the 1998
        NFL Draft. From 1998 to 2010, he improved the fortunes of the struggling
        Colts franchise and helped transform them into consistent playoff
        contenders. During his tenure as starting quarterback, Manning led the
        team to eight division championships, two AFC championships, and one
        Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XLI, the franchise's first in over three
        decades, and their first since relocating to Indianapolis. He was named
        Super Bowl MVP in the team's victory, making him the first Colts player
        to receive the honor. After undergoing neck surgery that sidelined him
        for the 2011 season, Manning was released by the Colts and signed with
        the Broncos. Serving as the team's starting quarterback from 2012 to
        2015, he contributed to the Broncos clinching their division each year,
        and his career concluded with a victory in Super Bowl 50.
